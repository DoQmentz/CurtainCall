BetterDiscord Custom Theme

Trying to create a new BetterDiscord theme for everybody to use.

Thematically, it will be centered around the character "Jhin" from League of Legends (with a side of Camille).

Colour-wise, it is going to be mostly indigo-ish (colourcode #4B0082) and midnight blue (colourcode #191970) with bits of white and black.

BUT: I'm in baby shoes when it comes to programming CSS. It will take time to finish this project. If I finish it all.

However, once finished and approved by BetterDiscord moderation, you're welcome to use and modify the theme to your heart's content!

Sincerely,

DoQ
